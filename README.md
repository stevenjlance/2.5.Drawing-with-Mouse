# Drawing with the Mouse
Today we will be learning to draw with our mouse! Complete the activities outlined below. Use the attached images to help facilitate your consrtruction of the required code!

## Tasks
**Explore**: On the `script.js`, uncomment line 9 and observe what happens. Why do you think you see what you see? Delete line 7. Why does the image change as a result?

After completing the code-along portion on the slides, try to create each of the images shown below.

**CHALLENGE #1**: When the mouse is on the left side of the screen, draw a circle that is one color. When the mouse is the right side of the screen, draw a circle that is a different color.

**CHALLENGE #2**: Change the color **at least** 4 times as the mouse moves across the screen. A continuous line of circles should be drawn as a result.

**CHALLENGE #3**: Draw a rainbow of colors as the mouse moves across the screen. *HINT*: Think about how you can change the fill as the mouse moves based on the mouseX and/or y position.

**CHALLENGE #4**: Using `mouseX`, `mouseY`, `pmouseX`, and `pmouseY`, create code that will draw a line that changes to at least 3 different colors as the line moves across the canvas.

**CHALLENGE #5**: Using `mouseX`, `mouseY`, `pmouseX`, and `pmouseY`, create code that changes the color of the line every time the mouse goes off the screen.

**CHALLENGE #6**: Using `mouseX`, `mouseY`, `pmouseX`, and `pmouseY`, create code that draws a line that is a rainbow of colors as it moves across the screen.
